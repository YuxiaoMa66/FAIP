We will use the lake problem as a test case, this is a classic problem initially developed by Carpenter et al. (1999) where the population of a city has to decide the amount of annual pollution it will release into a lake.  In this exercise, we will use the adapted version in [Quinn et al. 2017](https://www-sciencedirect-com.tudelft.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S1364815216302250?casa_token=wBdtfic9L4YAAAAA:Oum4EU3ob7bgKoCK2WhEFfOfIGUrsXpvp7PSvnRyMbDSF8lHXdf48H5hMe6d0DS1zChv5IhO) were the problem is defined as a state-based control problem (where actions are a function of the state of the system).  In this case, the 'action' is the Phosphorous (P) emissions which are optimized to balance the economic benefits and the quality of the lake. Since this is a multi-objective problem,  we need a flexible function to map the states to actions, so we use radial basis functions to parameterize the emission control policies. In fact, the MOEA will search for the optimal radii, centers and weights that yield good performance for the objectives of the lake model described below.  See the paper for more details about the problem formulation.\n","\n","The model is defined by the following equation:\n","\n","$\n","    X_{(t+1)}=X_t+a_t+\\frac{(X_t^q)}{(1+X_t^q )}- bX_t+\\epsilon_t\n","$\n","\n","where $X_t$ is the pollution at time $t$, $a_t$ is the rate of anthropogenic pollution at time $t$, $b$ is the lake’s natural removal rate, $q$ is the lake's natural recycling rate, $\\epsilon_t$ is the rate of natural pollution at time $t$. The rate of anthropogenic pollution $a_t$ is the decision variable where $a_t \\in [0,0.1]$. \n","\n","There are four outcomes of interest. The first is the average concentration of phosphor in the lake. \n","\n","$\n","    f_{phosphorus}=  \\frac{1}{\\left\\vert{T}\\right\\vert} \\sum\\limits_{t\\in{T}} X_t \n","$\n","\n","where $\\left\\vert{T}\\right\\vert$ is the cardinality of the set of points in time. \n","The second objective is the economic benefit derived from polluting the lake defined as the discounted benefit of pollution minus the costs of having a polluted lake.\n","\n","$ f_{economic} = \\sum\\limits_{t \\in {T}}\\alpha a_t \\delta^t$\n","\n","where $\\alpha$ is the utility derived from polluting and $\\delta$ is the discount rate. By default, $\\alpha$ is 0.04.\n","The third objective is related to the year over year change in the anthropogenic pollution rate. \n","\n","$ f_{inertia} = \\frac{1}{\\left\\vert{T}\\right\\vert-1}\\sum \\limits_{t=1}^{\\left\\vert{T}\\right\\vert}I(|a_{t}-a_{t-1} |>\\tau)$ \n","\n","where $I$ is an indicator function that is 0 if the statement is false, and 1 if the statement is true, $\\tau$ is the threshold that is deemed undesirable, and is for illustrative purposes et to 0.2. Effectively, f_{inertia} is the fraction of years where the absolute value of the change in anthropogenic pollution is larger then $\\tau$.\n","The fourth objective is the fraction of years where the pollution in the lake is below the critical threshold.\n","\n","$\n","    f_{reliability} =  \\frac{1}{\\left\\vert{T}\\right\\vert} \\sum\\limits_{t \\in T}I(X_{t}<X_{crit} ) \n","$\n","\n","where $I$ is an indicator function that is 0 if the statement is false, and 1 if the statement is true, $X_{crit}$ is the critical threshold of pollution and is a function of both $b$ and $q$.\n","\n","The lake problem is characterized by both stochastic uncertainty and deep uncertainty. The stochastic uncertainty arises from the natural inflow. To reduce this stochastic uncertainty, multiple replications are performed and the average over the replication is taken. Deep uncertainty is presented by uncertainty about the mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $sigma$ of the lognormal distribution characterizing the natural inflow, the natural removal rate of the lake $\\beta$, the natural recycling rate of the lake $q$, and the discount rate $\\delta$. The table below specifies the ranges for the deeply uncertain factors, as well as their best estimate or default values.
