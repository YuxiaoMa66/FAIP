Privacy and the Case of Gillian Brockell
In this case, the type of privacy that is violated is informational privacy. This type of privacy is about how personal data is collected, used, and shared by companies. Gillian's situation shows how algorithms used her pregnancy data but failed to account for the fact that her baby was stillborn. As a result, she kept seeing ads for baby products, which caused her emotional distress. The solution to this issue could involve creating more sensitive algorithms that understand changes in a person's life. For instance, if the system sees keywords like "heartbroken" or notices that the user is suddenly less active online, it could adjust the ads accordingly. Another solution could allow users to manually update their preferences when significant life events occur, such as a miscarriage or stillbirth.

There are several reasons why preserving privacy in this case is essential. First, it helps protect emotional well-being. Gillian’s experience shows how receiving irrelevant ads during a painful period can cause additional emotional harm. Second, people should have control over how their personal information is used, especially in sensitive matters like pregnancy. Lastly, pregnancy and related events are deeply personal and private. Companies must handle such data with greater care to avoid causing harm to users who are grieving or in vulnerable situations.

To prevent situations like Gillian's, companies need to conduct three types of investigations. First, they should carry out empirical research by speaking to users affected by similar issues, such as those who have experienced miscarriages. This will give them a better understanding of the emotional consequences of their algorithms. Second, companies need to think carefully about the values that should be included in their systems, such as empathy and respect for users' emotions. Lastly, companies need to develop the technology to allow algorithms to recognize changes in user behavior. For example, if someone stops using social media for a few days or posts about a tragic event, the algorithm should adjust accordingly.

There are three main values that should be included in the design of these algorithms. The first is privacy, ensuring that users' personal data is handled carefully and respectfully. The second is empathy, where the system needs to be aware of the emotional state of the user. Lastly, autonomy is crucial, giving users control over what data is collected and how it is used. However, these values can sometimes conflict with each other. For example, to make the algorithm empathetic, companies may need more personal data, which could violate privacy. Similarly, if users do not update their life events manually, the algorithm may not be able to adjust properly, which could affect the level of empathy in the system.

Bias and Fairness in the Healthcare Algorithm
In the case of the healthcare algorithm, racial bias was identified as the main issue. The algorithm, which was designed to assess patients' needs based on their healthcare spending, ended up underestimating the needs of black patients. This is because the algorithm assumed that people who spent less on healthcare had fewer medical problems, but in reality, black patients often had more health issues despite spending less. The problem here is that the system did not take into account the inequalities in healthcare access and quality that affect different racial groups.

The source of this bias is historical data, which reflects the existing inequalities in the healthcare system. The algorithm was trained on past healthcare spending data, which already disadvantages black patients due to systemic issues in access to healthcare. Another source of bias could be that the dataset used to train the algorithm did not include enough diversity, meaning that the experiences of minority groups were underrepresented. Additionally, the measurement used—healthcare spending—did not accurately capture the medical needs of black patients, leading to unfair results.

Two forms of unfairness are present in this algorithm. First, the data used by the system unfairly represented black patients, as it relied on spending as a measure of need. Second, the outcomes produced by the system were also unfair because black patients were less likely to receive high-risk care despite having more health issues. To address these forms of unfairness, the algorithm should include more direct measures of health, such as the severity of chronic conditions or the number of emergency visits, rather than relying on financial data.

If a national health agency (NHA) wanted to implement a similar algorithm for managing high-risk patients, they should take several precautions to avoid bias and unfairness. First, the data used to train the algorithm should include a diverse range of patients to ensure that all groups are fairly represented. Additionally, the metrics used to assess patients' needs should not rely solely on financial factors like healthcare spending, which can be influenced by socioeconomic inequalities. Regular audits should be conducted to ensure that the algorithm is treating all patients equally, and the system should be transparent, allowing doctors and patients to understand how decisions are made. By considering these factors, the NHA can create a fairer and more equitable healthcare system.
